# Backup Optimization Tools: Tower of Hanoi Strategies

This repository contains three projects that leverage dynamic programming, efficient algorithms, and the Tower of Hanoi principles to optimize backup rotations and data management. Each project includes a unique approach to scheduling and resource allocation.

## Repository Contents

### 1. **FourPeg**
   - **Description**: Implements dynamic programming strategies to optimize the number of moves in traditional Tower of Hanoi backup rotation. 
   - **Features**:
     - Dynamic scheduling of disk movements.
     - Backup file creation and movement tracking.
     - Space and time efficiency calculation.

---

### 2. **test**
   - **Description**: A flexible, generalized version of the Tower of Hanoi algorithm for backup scenarios. Designed to handle varying numbers of disks and constraints dynamically.
   - **Features**:
     - Supports flexible input sizes and dynamic reconfiguration.
     - Advanced logging of operations.

### 3. **testDP**
   - **Description**: This project analyzes and visualizes the movement patterns in a backup rotation strategy using a DP-enhanced Hanoi algorithm.
   - **Features**:
     - Advanced visualization of disk movements.
     - In-depth analysis of space and time complexities.
